# Scipy Day 1 Notes #

## Keynote: SciPy ##

* Scipy has a roadmap... that sounds pretty great

## Scikit Learn ##

* What is ninja build tools?
* Cmake is getting really popular

## Auto ML ##

AutoML are libraries that automate the selection and automation of the machine learning algorithms.

## Sparse - A more modern sparse array library ##

* indexing uses a binary search, which is more expensive than expanding the array
* scipy sparse has no views, therefore no compat with numpy

## Beyond Scraping ##

* production and research are different
* performance is more imporant in prod
